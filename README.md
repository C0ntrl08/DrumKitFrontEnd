# Drum Kit Project

## Overview

The Drum Kit Project is a web-based application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on images or pressing corresponding keyboard keys. This project is designed to provide an interactive and fun way to learn about front-end development concepts while creating a musical instrument interface.

The idea of the project, the images, as well as the sounds, are not my property. They all belong to Dr. Angela Yu. The repository was created for practice purposes only.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Kit**: Users can click on drum images or press specified keys on the keyboard to play different drum sounds.
- **Visual Feedback**: Drums provide visual feedback when clicked or when the corresponding key is pressed.
- **Responsive Design**: The drum kit layout adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, handling events, and playing sounds.
